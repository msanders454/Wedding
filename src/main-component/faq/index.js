                                            pets, but if you want to cool. But please no pets at the ceremony or reception though. We are actually thinking about bring our cat Boog. So if you

                                        <p> We do have rooms blocked at hotel/venue. That is where Mike and Jessi will be staying (and where the reception is, so it is convenient for people looking to get drunk). Just mention that
                                            you are part of the Hammond-Sanders wedding on May 27th. They are booked for Friday, May 26th and Sat May 27th. It is memorial day weekend, so if you choose to stay an extra day (Sunday night) know that the rooms are not blocked that night, so it is 
                                            not guaranteed and prices may change. 

                                            The hotel should be $149 for Friday and Saturday night, but if you choose to stay extra days outside of our blocked time the price could vary.
                                            If you would like to use the hotel, you will need to book by April 26th, after that day they release the unused rooms.

                                            Other hotels are available. Here is a list of other hotels near the venue.

                                        <p>During the ceromony, no. We ask that you do NOT take pictures. We will have a professional photographer and we trust them to do their job. We will post pictures that you can save.

                                            The reception is fair game though. Take as many pictures as you want. We ask that you do not post them on Social Media
                                            until we post our own pictures. But when you do post please tag us!! And if you would like to send us pictures you can send to the email listed below.

                                            but theres still a lot to do. Information for what to do will be listed soon.

                                            of you have our numbers so you can contact us there as well. We both prefer text over phone calls.

                                            During the Wedding weekend, especially Wedding day, we might be busy and unable to respond to you during
                                            that time. In that case, you can contact our Matron of Honor Rachael Robinson, and Best Man Bilal Ahmed for
                                            any wedding questions.
