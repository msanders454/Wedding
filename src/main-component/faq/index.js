                                        <p> The wedding ceremony starts at 2:30pm. That means we start at 2:30. Not 2:35, not 2:45, not 3pm. 
                                            We will start with or without you. I would suggest arriving at the ceromony 30 minutes before the ceremony. The Reception
                                            starts 6 pm. Arrive 30 minutes before that as well.

                                        <p>The Graduate has 20 rooms blocked for us. That is where Mike and Jessi will be staying (and where the reception is, so it is convenient for people looking to get drunk). Just mention that
                                            you are part of the Hammond-Sanders wedding on May 27th. They are booked for Friday, May 26th and Sat May 27th. However, because it will be
                                            Memorial Day weekend, Jessi and I plan to stay Sunday as well. If you want to stay Sunday as well, tell the Graduate that you want to book for SUnday as well. Please know that Sunday is not
                                            on the Hammond-Sanders list, so Sunday rooms are not guarantee. 

                                            The Graduate should be $149 for Friday and Saturday night, but if you choose to stay extra days outside of our blocked time the price could vary.
                                            If you would like to use the Graduate, you will need to book by April 26th, after that day they release the unused rooms.

                                            Other hotels besides the Graduate are available. Here is a list of other hotels near the Graduate.

                                            The reception is fair game though. Take as many pictures as you want. Do not post them on Social Media
                                            until we post our own pictures. But when you do post please tag us!! And if you would like to send us pictures you can send to the email listed below.
